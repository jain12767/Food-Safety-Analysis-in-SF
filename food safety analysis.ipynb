The distribution also has a long left tail, with some restaurants recieving scores in the 50s, 60s or 70s. An unusual feature of this distribution is that even number scores have higher counts than odd number scores. This could be bacause the penalty scores incredment in even numbers (eg: 2, 4, 6, 8)."

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
